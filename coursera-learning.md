# Learning

## Introduction

* Focus Mode - Concentrate on something you're trying to learn.  Pinball bumpers, thoughts bounce off these.  Figure out problem trying to solve. 
* Diffused Mode - More relaxed.  Wider spaced bumpers, new neural connections.  We don't know the thought.  We don't know the pattern.

Either one or the other mode, not both.

Neuroscience, cognitive psychology focus.

Accessing difused mode

Diffused Mode - when relaxed, Dali and Edison.  Keys and spheres.

## Procrastination

Negative simulation - switch attention to something else

Pomodoro Technique

## Practice

Practice makes Permanent - recreating something from scratch.  Memorising the pattern.

Build strong structures by doing a little bit every day.  Don't cram!

# Memory

Remembering involves long term memory
* Lots of spaces for information

Bring something into working memory to think about it
* Conscious memory (only holds 4 chunks)
* Need to repeat things for them to stay in working memory
* Pre-frontal cortex

Moving things between working -> long term

Spaced repititon - repeating what you want to retain
* Has to be done over several days
* Forms the synaptic connections

Sleep in Learning:
* Being awake causes toxic poisons in your head
* Sleep helps keep your mind healthy
* Erases less important parts
* Strengthens the other parts

If you go over what you've learned BEFORE sleep it greatly helps your ability to remember them.
